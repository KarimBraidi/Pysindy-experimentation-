# Pysindy-experimentation-
This repository contains an experimental Python implementation using the PySINDy library to explore techniques of the paper titled "Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems".

It focuses on reconstructing governing equations directly from data â€” starting with the Lorenz system and extending to vortex shedding dynamics.
